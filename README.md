> Please seek appropriate legal counsel before publishing any works based on this project.

Dark Forge licence terms and copyright do not apply to the content you create with it; you are free to license your games how you see best fit, and will be their sole copyright owner(s).

Note, however, that the Dark Forge binary that you would distribute with your game is a copy of the "Software" as defined in the licence, and you are therefore required to include the copyright notice and licence statement somewhere in your documentation as described in the [GNU Affero General Public License terms](./.licenses/AGPLv3.md).

### Third-party dependencies

Third party dependencies are subject to their own licenses. These have been collected in the [LICENCE](LICENCE) file and in the [.attribution](./.attribution) directory. It is suggested that you review them and ensure that you are compliant with their terms. You may wish to copy them into your own project as well.

A good-faith effort is continuously being made to attribute all sources and dependencies and ensure that all licences are compatible and that we are compliant with their terms.

However, as a small team, we cannot guarantee that we have met all requirements. Please seek your own legal advice before publishing any works based on this project.

If you are a right holder for any of the works we have used, please contact us at `legal (at) hibiscusgames.com` if you have any questions or concerns, and we will endeavour to address them promptly.
